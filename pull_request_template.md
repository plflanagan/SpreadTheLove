<This is a template for Pull Requests to help standardize our pull requests and make sure that they contain all the information we would like. Note that anything in carrots can be deleted, and is for explanation.>

### <Title of Pull Request> 
<Should be something like "IOS-123 - Title", where title is either the name of the task or something briefer yet still explanatory.>

### Jira Ticket
[]() <Please put the Jira ticket here. For example, [IOS-1](https://unumdesign.atlassian.net/browse/IOS-1)>

### Purpose
<Please put the purpose of the Pull Request here. This often will be similar to the Jira ticket; so you don't need to go into too much detail since it is linked above. But it should be clear enough that I shouldn't have to read the Jira ticket in order to know what this work is about.>

### Approach
<How did you solve the problem?>

### Screenshots/GIFS
#### Before
<It can be helpful to post screenshots or gifs of what was happening or what things looked like before the changes. Being able to contrast in this way can help make the code-changes clearer.>

#### After
<Part of the point of the PR description is to enable quicker review of PRs, thus speeding up the development process. A very important thing that the writer can do is to provide screenshots of anything in the UI that is updated in this work.>
<GIFs are a very important inclusion if there is every anything animation-related, or if there is a sequence of steps to show the effects of the update. If you don't have a script to do this locally, https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif is a great site to use, as it gives you control over the FPS -- ideal for making sure your gif doesn't drag on and that the reviewer can quickly get a sense of what is going on.>
